Licensor may require you to verify any changes to personal information. Licensor may use your personal information to validate your personal license rights, to prove to the reseller where you purchased your Twidroyd license that you purchased your Twidroyd license there and to contact you with information related to Twidroyd. Licensor may share this information with its licensors. Licensor will not sell or license usage of your personal information to third parties.

 2. GENERAL TERMS These General Terms are applicable on the Free License and the Commercial License.

 ADDITIONAL ACTIVATIONS The Commercial License both do not allow Twidroyd to be activated and used on more devices than the number of devices you have obtained said License(s) for. Licensor may, at its sole discretion, for your convenience decide to allow you to activate Twidroyd on additional devices within reasonable limits.

Licensor may, at its sole discretion, decide to suspend further activations performed under said License(s), and/or render said License(s) null and void, if it considers the amount of activations performed under said License(s) to be excessive. You and/or the person performing activation will be informed of such a decision either a) in writing, b) by email and/or c) from within the Twidroyd Software.

 Third Party Software Twidroyd may utilize or include third party software that is subject to open source and third party license terms (“Third Party Software”). You acknowledge and agree that your right to use such Third Party Software as part of Twidroyd is subject to and governed by the terms and conditions of the open source or third party license applicable to such Third Party Software, including, without limitation, any applicable acknowledgements, license terms and disclaimers contained therein. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this License Agreement and the terms of such open source or third party licenses, the terms of the open source or third party licenses shall control with regard to your use of the relevant Third Party Software. In no event, shall Twidroyd or components thereof be deemed to be “open source” or “publically available” software. 

 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Licensor is providing you Twidroyd on an as-is basis without warranty of any kind. Licensor does not and cannot warrant the performance or results you may obtain by use of Twidroyd. Licensor does not and cannot warrant that Twidroyd operates error-free. Licensor does not warrant that Twidroyd operates on the type of device owned by you and you shall be solely responsible for obtaining a device compatible with Twidroyd. Licensor expressly disclaims to the fullest extent permitted by law all express, implied, and statutory warranties, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights. Licensor disclaims any warranties regarding the security, reliability, timeliness, and performance of the software. You understand that you download, install, and/or use the software at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download, installation, or use of the software. 

 EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES. Under no circumstances shall Licensor be liable to you on account of your use or misuse of the software. Such limitation of liability shall apply to prevent recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, and punitive damages whether such claim is based on warranty, contract, tort, or otherwise, even if Twidroyd has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Such limitation of liability shall include, but is not limited to, damages for loss of profits or confidential or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss of privacy, for failure to meet any duty including of good faith or of reasonable care, for negligence, and for any other pecuniary or other loss whatsoever. Such limitation of liability shall apply whether the damages arise from use or misuse of and reliance on the software, from inability to use the software, or from the interruption, suspension, or termination of the software (including such damages incurred by third parties). Such limitation shall apply notwithstanding a failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy and to the fullest extent permitted by law. Some states or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you. 

 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY The risk of any and all loss, damage or unsatisfactory performance of Twidroyd rests with you as the user. If you rely upon Twidroyd, you do so at your own risk and you assume the responsibility for the results. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Licensor is not liable to you or to any third party for any damages, either direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or otherwise (including in each case, but not limited to damages rising from inability to use Twidroyd or access data, loss of data, loss of business, loss of profits, business interruptions, claims, suits or causes of action involving alleged infringement of copyrights, patens, trademarks, trade secrets or unfair competition or the like) arising out of the use or inability to use Twidroyd even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall Licensor's total liability to you exceed the greater of the amount for which you purchased a Twidroyd Commercial License or US$5.00. If you purchased your license in another currency, a fair estimation of the purchase price will be made by Licensor or its subsidiaries. Some states and/or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. 

 LIMITATION OF SUPPORT Licensor will make an effort to provide you with email support or a web-based help section pertaining to your use of Twidroyd. Said support will be limited to topics within the domain of basic usage of Twidroyd. Licensor is not required to reply to support requests or offer you general advice on technologies underlying or related to Twidroyd. Licensor reserves the right to cease offering support of any kind pertaining to the usage of older releases of Twidroyd whenever a new release, whether for free or for pay, of Twidroyd becomes available.

 INFRINGEMENT If Twidroyd is, or in Licensor's opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, Licensor shall have the right, without obligation and at its sole discretion, to: a) procure for you the right to continue to use Twidroyd; b) replace or modify Twidroyd in such a way as to make the modified version of Twidroyd non-infringing; or c) terminate this License Agreement, provided that in the event of such termination, Licensor shall refund the License fees paid by you on a prorated basis, taking into account the term Twidroyd has been used or owned, whichever is longer, by you. The foregoing states Licensor's and its subsidiaries entire liability and obligation to you and your sole remedy with respect to any actual or alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of any kind.

 LICENSE CODE Licensor may issue a license code or license key to you, which you may need to activate Twidroyd under the terms of the Commercial License. Licensor and its subsidiaries and distributors may link said license code or license key to you personally. Any given license code or license key is considered for your usage only and may not be distributed, published or otherwise communicated to third parties by you, unless permission to do so is granted to you in writing by Licensor.

Inaction of Licensor to terminate this License Agreement after you fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions set out in this License Agreement does not imply a waiver of any kind of the rights reserved by Licensor under this and other provisions.
